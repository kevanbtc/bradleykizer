# Bradley Kizer Family Wealth System

## TEUCRIUM-Style Tokenized Commodity ETF Infrastructure

This repository contains a complete tokenized commodity fund system modeled after TEUCRIUM's ETF structure, built specifically for the Bradley Kizer family wealth management operation.

## üéØ System Overview

The system enables the family to:
- Digitize physical asset custody receipts as NFTs
- Issue fungible unit tokens (grams/tons/credits) backed by receipts  
- Create investor fund shares with KYC/AML compliance
- Earn management fees and creation/redemption fees
- Provide transparent NAV and proof-of-reserves

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ReceiptNFT** - ERC-721 custody receipts for physical assets
2. **UnitToken** - ERC-20 fungible units (XAUg, CARBt, WTRc) backed by receipts
3. **KYCRegistry** - Investor compliance and partition management
4. **FamilyGovernance** - Multi-sig family roles and voting
5. **FundVault4626Enhanced** - ERC-4626 vaults with fee accrual
6. **FundShare1400Enhanced** - Partitioned fund shares (Reg D/S/Family/Institutional)

## üîÑ Operational Flow

### 1. Asset Loading
```solidity
// Custodian mints receipt NFT after physical custody
receiptNFT.mintReceipt(
    familyVault,
    "GOLD",
    20000,  // 20kg = 20,000 grams
    "BRINKS_VAULT_NYC_001",
    "serial_12345",
    "ipfs_hash_of_assay_docs"
);
```

### 2. Unit Token Issuance
```solidity
// Vault mints unit tokens against receipt
goldUnitToken.mintFromReceipt(receiptId, familyVault);
// Result: 20,000,000 XAUg tokens (20kg * 1000g/kg * 1000mg/g)
```

### 3. Fund Share Creation
```solidity
// AP deposits unit tokens, gets fund shares
goldVault.deposit(unitTokens, investorAddress);
// Shares are partitioned based on investor KYC status
```

### 4. Fee Collection
```solidity
// Management fees accrue automatically
// Family collects fees to treasury wallet
goldVault.collectFees();
```
